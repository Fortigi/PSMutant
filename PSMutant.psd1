Injects small faults (flip -eq to -ne, $true to $false, N to N+1, drop -not) into your scripts using the PowerShell AST and reports how many your Pester suite catches - the metric line coverage cannot give you. Runs mutants in a throwaway sandbox so your source is never modified. Requires Pester 5.0.0 or later AT RUN TIME, and deliberately does not declare it as a RequiredModule: PSMutant runs under whichever Pester >= 5 you have loaded rather than importing one for you. Install Pester yourself if you do not already have it.'

    # One function. Get-PSMutationCandidate and Set-PSMutationText used to be exported too,
    # and between them they trafficked a nine-field [pscustomobject] that nothing declared,
    # tested as a contract or versioned -- discoverable only by running the function and
    # inspecting the output, and unchangeable once someone had. Neither was ever mentioned in
    # the README, and Set-PSMutationText had exactly one caller, inside this module (#48).
    #
    # "What would you mutate?" is a fair question to ask, and the answer should be a rendering
    # this module controls -- see #10's -ListOnly -- not a raw AST walker handing out its
    # internals.

    # NO RequiredModules entry for Pester, deliberately. ModuleVersion there is a MINIMUM
    # and PowerShell satisfies it by importing the NEWEST installed version -- at import
    # time, before Assert-PSMutationPester or Get-PSMutationPesterPath can have a say. That
    # made `Import-Module PSMutant` followed by `Import-Module Pester -RequiredVersion 5.7.1`
    # fail on an assembly collision and leave the caller on 6.1.0, while the same two lines
    # in the other order worked -- issue #16's failure one layer up, with no diagnostic.
    #
    # Pester is needed at RUN time, not import time, and Assert-PSMutationPester is the single
    # point that enforces it: it accepts an already-loaded Pester >= 5, imports one only when
    # none is loaded, and refuses with an actionable message otherwise. The cost is that
    # Install-Module PSMutant no longer pulls Pester in for you; that is stated in the
    # description, the README and the error message.

            ReleaseNotes = 'FIXED, both of the same kind - the tool reporting a number it did not measure. A per-mutant timeout could resolve to zero when timeoutFloorSeconds and timeoutFactor were both small: a zero-second budget expires at once, an expired mutant counts as a kill, and so every mutant was scored Killed on the clock rather than on behaviour - a perfect score, exit 0, over tests that never ran. The budget must now be at least as long as your unmutated suite took, and a config asking for less is refused with a message saying so; if this affected you, the run that fails after upgrading is the honest one. And a config path with a leading .. escaped the temp sandbox and was mutated where it lives, in your working tree - interrupt such a run and the mutated file stays on disk. Those are refused now, while a path that contains .. and still resolves inside the source root keeps working. Requires PowerShell 7.2+ and Pester 5.0+; Pester is a run-time dependency and is deliberately not declared in RequiredModules, so PSMutant runs under whichever Pester 5 or 6 your repo already has.'
