## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- CI now gates complexity using the **PSComplexity** module (a faithful cognitive
  metric), replacing the bundled `tools/Get-PSComplexity.ps1`. The two Fortigi modules
  dogfood each other: PSMutant's CI uses PSComplexity for its complexity gate, and
  PSComplexity's CI uses PSMutant to mutation-test itself.
- Pinned CI tooling (Pester 5.8.0, PSScriptAnalyzer 1.25.0) and SHA-pinned actions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03
### Added
- Initial release.
- AST-based mutation operators: binary operators (`-eq`↔`-ne`, `-and`↔`-or`,
  `+`↔`-`, …), boolean literals (`$true`↔`$false`), integer literals (`N`→`N+1`),
  quoted strings (`→ ''`, opt-in), and negation removal (`-not X`→`X`).
- Sandboxed execution — mutants run against a throwaway temp copy, so tracked source
  is never modified even if the run is killed.
- Per-mutant wall-clock timeout (cancellable runspace): a non-terminating mutant —
  e.g. a mutated loop body that defeats a guarded loop — is cut off and counted Killed
  instead of hanging the run. The loop-condition guard is a speed optimisation on top.
- Covered-lines-only filtering (Pester code coverage), per-file test mapping.
- JSON report + console summary; report-only or `thresholds.break` gating.
- `Invoke-PSMutation`, `Get-PSMutationCandidate`, `Set-PSMutationText` exported.
